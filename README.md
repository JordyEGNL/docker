# Docker Compose files for my home servers

This repository contains everything I need to deploy my Docker Containers on my servers (compose & config files). These files are automatically deployed to my servers using [Komodo](https://komo.do/). Most updates will be merged  automatically by Renovate, but sometimes I need to manually change or approve things :)
